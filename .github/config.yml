  💖 Thanks for opening this pull request! 💖
  A good commit message should describe what changed and why.
  We use [semantic commit messages](https://github.com/virgilwashere/mautic-cron-commands/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-guidelines) to streamline the release process. Before your pull request can be merged, you should **update your pull request title** to start with a semantic prefix.
  Examples of commit messages with semantic prefixes:
  - `docs: 📝 address the upgrade process`
  - `feat: ✨ add command write:docs:forme`
  - `fix: 🐛 lookup the correct parameter`
  You are encouraged to [include applicable emoji](https://github.com/virgilwashere/mautic-cron-commands/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#emoji) in commit messages after the semantic prefix.
  # Things that will help get your PR across the finish line:
  # - Follow the JavaScript, C++, and Python [coding style](https://github.com/virgilwashere/mautic-cron-commands/blob/master/docs/coding-style.md).
  # - Run `npm run lint` locally to catch formatting errors earlier.
  # - Document any user-facing changes you've made following the [documentation styleguide](https://github.com/virgilwashere/mautic-cron-commands/blob/master/docs/styleguide.md).
  # - Include tests when adding/changing behavior.
  # - Include screenshots and animated GIFs whenever possible.
  # We get a lot of pull requests on this repo, so please be patient and we will get back to you as soon as we can.
